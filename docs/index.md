# DawTools 
#### Digital Audio Workstation tools for Python

***

The initial aim of this project is to provide PyQt/PySide widgets to aid on daw type projects.

The project is build using PySide but can easily be ported to PyQt by editing main.py imports.


Current Versions and dependencies
* Python Version 3.9
* PySide Version 6.1.2


ROAD MAP
--------

### Future Widgets
* Piano Roll
* Envelope with curves
* Timeline
* Transpose
* Mixer Channel
* Mixer
* Step Sequencer


REASON
------
I've been producing/composing/mixing music for over 20 years and programming for 10.

I decided to move forward with a little project I long been dreaming of for music composition and came across seq-gui.
I found seq-gui very interesting and decided to fork it as it had not been updated for 7 years.

The industry standard for building audio applications seems to be [JUCE](https://juce.com/) at the moment.
But JUCE uses C++, a language that makes me physically ill just looking at it :D

Considering my idea does not need all the intricacies that JUCE offers, I'm going with python.
So all the widgets in daw-tools will be applied in a real world application.
This means I will keep updating this project as I find bugs when implementing.

At the moment it's still in early development so I've just been updating improvements where I see fit with no branches or version
control but as soon as the GRID dependent widgets are finished, version control will start.

You are welcome to participate in this project!
