# Getting Started

Download and add daw_tools directory to your python project, then:

```python
import daw_tools
piano = daw_tools.Piano()
```

All the files in the top level folder are examples of how to use the already finished widgets.


At the moment each file in the daw-tools folder has an embedded example for development ease,
this makes the library quite big in size and it will be removed as the library matures
and the examples are all moved to the top level folder.
